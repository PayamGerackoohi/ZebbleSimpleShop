# Version 1.0.0

## Known Bugs

### Scroll Issue
- Mouse or drag by pointer sometimes does not work, specially when scrolling over an inner row. It's interesting that both trackpad and mouse wheel could easily scroll everywhere, even in the before mentioned areas. Seems to be Zebble rendering bug.

### UI Margins
- UI margin is sometimes ignored in rendering. AwaitNative addition is tried, but seems not relevant. Seems to be Zebble rendering bug.

### No Symbols Loaded
- Seldom it happens that app crashed meanwhile navigating. Visual Studio claims: "System.NullReferenceException: 'Object reference not set to an instance of an object.'". Unfortunately there is no clear error log, which could describe where it happened. By the way it's tried to fix any cavity which could make this null reference blindly in the whole app, but still it crashes.
- "Zebble.BoxShadow.pdb not loaded". No idea what it means.

### ItemPicker UI
- ItemPicker dialog sometimes does not wrap content as it supposed to be. Pure Zebble bug. No solution is applicable from the user developer side.

### App Halt
- It seems strolling in app would fill the memory up and halt and exit the app. No idea why it happens and how to solve it.

### DatePicker Awkward UI (UWP)
- The wheels would just be scrolled if they're clicked and up-down arrow keys are used. They're responding neither to the mouse drag nor the trackpad scroll.

### DatePicker Crash On Default
- If from-to years are set on a DatePicker, then pressing ok without turning any wheels would crash inside try closure of System.Runtime.CompilerServices.AsyncVoidMethodBuilder.Start at stateMachine.MoveNext() with null reference exception. without from-to it would work. I call it a featureless DatePicker.

## Resolved Bugs

### Favorites List
- On Nav back on the detailed product page, when it's removed from the favorites list, the removed view would stay in the list, although ListView claims that both the DataSource and children count are decreased, but it renders out of the canvas and ClipChildren = true even would be reset to false and no idea why does not work.

### TextInput Cannot Be Disabled
- "TextInput.Enable = false" does not disable it and it seems there is no other neat way to do so.
